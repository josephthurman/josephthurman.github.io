    <p>When you're a mathematics PhD student, whatever you're working on is likely to be totally inscrutable to just about anyone you meet, even many fellow mathematicians. This is probably true for advanced academic work in nearly any field, but I think the problem is especially bad in pure mathematics, for two main reasons.</p>
<p>The first is that the the objects of study in mathematics are often either unfamiliar or, to an outsider, hopelessly abstract. As a comparison, one of my brothers is working on a PhD in biology, studying evolution in butterflies. The real details of his work are beyond me, but I learned the basics of evolution in high school, and I definitely know what a butterfly is. In contrast, my academic research involves various constructions related to quaternion-K&auml;hler manifolds, and if you know what that means, congratulations to you on finishing your math PhD! </p>
<p>The second problem is that most people don't really understand what "math research" actually means. This is mainly the fault of mathematicians themselves. The way that students learn math in school, as a collection of formulas to be applied to solving problems on a worksheet or a collection of techniques for computing various numbers, is very different from the way mathematicians actually do math. Instead, mathematicians consider abstract structures with certain properties - numbers with addition rules, for example - and try to understand the logical consequences of those properties - e.g., what is the largest number? Does such a thing exist? In this way mathematics is often more like philosophy, or even art, and it's the job of mathematicians to come up with new ways to analyze and understand these structure. </p>
<p>This post is the first in a series that will ultimately attempt to explain the results of my thesis to a general audience. I hope not only to explain the esoteric and abstract objects that I spend most of my time thinking about, but also to demonstrate the way that mathematicians think about math. Before embarking on that journey, though, I'll give the shortest summary of my work that I can. It's common advice for academics of all types to always have a short "elevator pitch" explanation of their research that they could give to anyone. I've been asked to explain my research so rarely that I've never really prepared one. If I had, though, it would probably go like this:</p>
<h2>The Two-Minute Summary</h2>
<p>I work in differential geometry, an area of mathematics that studies how to measure distances in spaces, and how spaces can themselves curve and bend. The most familiar type of geometric space is a flat, 2-dimensional plane - basically a sheet of paper. High school geometry is really the study of this one space - learning about angles, distances, shapes, etc.</p>
<p>There are other spaces that one can study, though, with different geometries. For example, the surface of the earth is a different example. It is also a two-dimensional geometry (this means that you can specify a location using two numbers, latitude and longitude), and you can still talk about distances between points, angles, and shapes on this surface. There are some important differences, though: for example, you could continue walking straight in a fixed direction, walk around the whole world, and eventually end up back at your starting point. </p>
<p>The main difference between these two geometries is a property called curvature. In two dimensions, there is a number that one can assign to every point of a space that describes how curved that space is. For the flat piece of paper, that number is 0 for every point. For the sphere, that number is positive, and is large for very small spheres, but large for very big spheres. For example, the curvature of the earth would be a small, but positive number - in fact the earth seems flat when you walk around, but if you could walk around on the surface of a smaller sphere, like a basketball, you'd definitely notice the curvature. There are also two dimensional spaces of negative curvature, "negative" just being a convention to mean that the surface curves in different directions. An example is the surface of a horse saddle. If you sit in the saddle, it curves down to the ground on the left and right (where your legs go), but curves up in front and behind. A sphere always curves in the same direction.</p>
<p>The curvature of an space can effect what type of shape it has, but "shape" here means something that mathematicians call "topology", is the idea of the shape of an object, but allowing for stretching or deforming. The best example is to consider the surface of a rubber ball. If one takes that ball and deflates it, or pinches it, or stretches it, it will change the <em>geometry</em> of the surface - for example, you could pinch part of the sphere to make it look like the surface of a saddle.  None of these changes, though, change the fact that the rubber ball is still ultimately ball-shaped, and this is what mathematicians mean by topology. Importantly, there are actually different "levels" of shape - the underlying topology, of a sphere, for example, and the additional level of a way to measure distances on that sphere, that can change even as the topology changes the same - for example, blowing up a balloon makes the distances between points larger, changing the geometry of the shape but not the topology. </p>
<p>This leads to a main question of differential geometry - given a shape (a topology), what kinds of geometry can it have? For a sphere, for example, it turns out that the geometry must always have some kind of positive curvature. Stated physically, it is impossible to take that rubber ball and deform it so that it has zero or negative curvature at every point. For example, you could flatten one side of the ball with your hand, but this will only make the sides bulge and curve more. There's a mathematical way to average all the curvature on the sphere, and a theorem called the Gauss-Bonnet theorem says that any geometry for a sphere must have positive curvature on average. This is somewhat related to why maps of the globe always involve some distortion - it's impossible to change an essentially positive curvature sphere into a flat piece of paper.</p>
<p>These concepts are easy to visualize in two dimensions, but most geometry research is concerned with higher dimensions, where things are much more complicated. According to general relativity, for example, the universe is a four-dimensional geometric object called a "spacetime," and the way that this spacetime curves determines the gravitational field. The concept of curvature also gets more complicated - in two dimensions, there is just one number that describes curvature, but in higher dimensions the idea of curvature is much more complicated, with many numbers describing the curvature of the space in the many possible different directions.</p>
<p>A "quaternion-K&auml;hler manifold," is a higher-dimensional space that has a very particular type of curvature, particular enough that only certain types of shapes (toplogies) can admit geometries that have this property. This special curvature property makes these geometries interesting in various mathematical applications and also in theoretical physics. My work on quaternion-K&auml;hler manifolds focuses on understanding exactly what types of topologies can admit these types of geometries, and how the properties of these spaces can be used to construct other geometries with interesting curvature properties. </p>
