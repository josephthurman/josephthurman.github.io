In that model, we assumed that at the end of a certain period of time, the value of a stock could take on one of two possible values.  We then used a variety of arguments, including replication and risk-neutral pricing, to determine a price for a call option on the stock.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, we'll see how this model can be improved to predict the movement of stock prices more accurately. We'll also make some simple modifications that allow us to consider some of the complicating factors we ignored in the last post, like interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Two-Step Model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's return to the example from the previous post, in which we assumed that a stock worth &amp;dollar;100 today would be worth either &amp;dollar;80 or &amp;dollar;120 in six months' time.  We used this assumption to find a price for a call option on the stock, expiring at the end of the same six-month period with a strike price of &amp;dollar;100.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model essentially assumed that there would be only one movement in the stock price in 6 months, or put another way, that we would only observe the stock price once over the life of the option. What if we looked multiple times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, instead of assuming that the stock could either increase or decrease by &amp;dollar;20 over a six-month period, let's assume that the stock can either increase or decrease by &amp;dollar;10 over each three-month period.  There are now four different possibilities for how the stock price can change as over the six-month period - it can either move up twice, move up and then down, move down and then up, or move down twice.  Letting &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(u, d\)&lt;/span&gt; denote up and down movements, respectively, and using &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S\)&lt;/span&gt; to denote the stock price today, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S_{u}\)&lt;/span&gt; to denote the price after an up movement, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S_{du}\)&lt;/span&gt; denote the price after a down and then an up movement, etc., we're left with the following tree of possible prices for the stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Two-Step Binomial Tree" src="http://www.josephthurman.com/tree1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that the price after an up movement in the first period followed by a down movement in the second period is the same as the price after a down movement followed by an up movement.  This will simplify the computations, especially when we fully generalize the model to include many intermediate steps.  The order of the up and down movements does not matter, only the total number of up movements and the total number down movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we find a price for the option under this new model? The method is to view this larger tree as a collection of smaller one-step models and repeatedly apply the pricing methods we described in the last post.  In particular, we can zoom in on just one part of the tree, the portion consisting of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S_u\)&lt;/span&gt; and the branches to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S_{uu}\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S_{ud}\)&lt;/span&gt;. If the final price is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S_{uu} = 120\)&lt;/span&gt;, then the option will be worth &amp;dollar;20, and if the final price is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S_{ud} = 100\)&lt;/span&gt;, then the option will be worth &amp;dollar;0.  We can then find the value of the option in three months time, assuming that the stock increased over the first period.  The easiest method for this is to use risk-neutral pricing.  We can compute that the risk-neutral probability in this situation is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p = 1/2\)&lt;/span&gt; (just as it was in the last post), and therefore the value of the option at the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S_u\)&lt;/span&gt; node of the tree is
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
C_u = 20 (1/2) + 0 (1/2) = 10
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can repeat this computation to find the value of the option at the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S_d\)&lt;/span&gt; node in the tree, that is, the value of the option in three month's time under the assumption that the stock first moves down.  From an initial value of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S_d = 90\)&lt;/span&gt;, the stock price can either move to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S_{dd} = 80\)&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S_{du} = 100\)&lt;/span&gt;.  In either case, the option will be worthless in six months (the strike price is 100), and therefore the value of the option at the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S_d\)&lt;/span&gt; node is zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if we know that the values &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(C_u = 10\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(C_d = 0\)&lt;/span&gt; for the option at the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S_u\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S_d\)&lt;/span&gt; nodes, then we can work backwards to find the initial value of the option.  The risk-neutral probability will once again be &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p = 1/2\)&lt;/span&gt;, and so the value of the option today is
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
C = 10 \times (1/2) + 0 \times (1/2) = 5
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The tree with the value of the option at the various nodes is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Option Values in Two-Step Binomial Tree" src="http://www.josephthurman.com/tree2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This value is different from the value of &amp;dollar;10 we found in the last post, but it's not hard to see why.  In the one-step model, we only had two possible values for the stock price at expiry, one in which the option has value (an up movement) and one in which it does not (a down movement). In the two step model, we have assumed that there are more possible values for the final price of the stock, and the option is worthless for these new possible values.  Thus under the new model there will be fewer opportunities to exercise the option and gain value from it, and so the option is worth less in the new model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's clear from the above example how we could continue to improve the model - instead of dividing the six-month time period into two three-month periods, we could divide it into 3, 4, 5, or even more periods.  Perhaps we could divide the interval into 20 periods, and the price could move up or down by one dollar in each period.  This would still imply that the stock price at the end of six months has a value between &amp;dollar;80 or &amp;dollar;120, but in this case any dollar value between these two numbers is also a possible outcome in the model, which is a much more realistic model than the two or three values we've had in the examples so far. Before discussing this generalization, though, we will consider how interest rates affect the model.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adding Interest Rates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we've ignored how interest rates and the time value of money would change our computations.  For example, in computing the value &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(C_u\)&lt;/span&gt; above, we assumed that if the option was expected to be worth &amp;dollar;10 at the end of the six-month period, its value at three months should be the same.  This is not the case, though, as the value of &amp;dollar;10 today is more than the value of &amp;dollar;10 in three month's time.  After all, if an investor has &amp;dollar;10 today, they could always a put the money into a completely safe investment, perhaps something like a savings account, and earn a small amount of interest so that, after three months time they have &amp;dollar;10.01 instead of just &amp;dollar;10.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of a payment therefore depends not only on the actual dollar amount of the payment, but on when the payment is made.  To be consistent in finding prices for financial assets, we need a way to find the value today of a payment made in the future, so that all prices under consideration are always in "today's" dollars. The idea is that if one will receive &amp;dollar;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(T\)&lt;/span&gt; month's time, the value of that payment &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; is the amount of money that would have to be invested today in a risk-free investment so that in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(T\)&lt;/span&gt; months that safe investment will have grown to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk-free investments do not actually exist in truth, but mathematical finance generally assumes that such investments are available. This is because short-term bonds issued by stable governments in their own currency are very safe investments. There is of course the possibility that, say, the US government may default on its debt, but this would have such major economic effects that accurately pricing options would be the least of an investor's worries. Still, because these assets have no risk, the rate of return is small - the current yield on three-month treasury bills is around 1.5% annually. The rate of return of the risk-free investment is appropriately known as the &lt;em&gt;risk-free rate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simplify computations, we'll assume that all interest is compounded continuously.  That is, if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; is the risk-free interest rate, written as a decimal (so that 1.5% = 0.015), then if one invests &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P\)&lt;/span&gt; dollars for a period of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(t\)&lt;/span&gt; years, the investment will grow to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(Pe^{rt}\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(e = 2.71828\ldots\)&lt;/span&gt; is Euler's number, the base of the natural logarithm. On the other hand, a cash payment of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; dollars at some time &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(t\)&lt;/span&gt; years in the future will have a present value today of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(Xe^{-rt}\)&lt;/span&gt;. We'll use this present value formula in the next section to compute the value of an option today if its future expected value is known. The number &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(e^{-rt}\)&lt;/span&gt; is called a &lt;em&gt;discount factor&lt;/em&gt;, since it is used to discount future values of a cash flow to their smaller present values.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the risk-free interest rate, and the related discount factor, are only appropriate for finding the present value of risk-free assets.  In general, if we wanted to find the present value of a future payment that had some amount of uncertainty, we'd need to choose an interest rate that reflected the uncertainty.  We could think of this as the rate of return that could be expected from investing our money in an equally risky asset. The expected values of the options we are pricing are technically risky, so in principle we should be finding a discount factor that reflects those risks.  This represents one more advantage of risk-neutral pricing - we can avoid the work of having to decide on a discount factor that is appropriate to the risk of the option. Instead, we ignore the risk, as we've done before, and use the risk-free interest rate to simplify our computations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Many-Step Model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With interest rates figured out, we're now ready to give the actual model. There's just one final change to make. In our two-step example above, we've assumed that the stock price moves by adding or subtracting fixed amounts.  In our final model, we'll instead assume that the price moves by a fixed &lt;em&gt;percentage&lt;/em&gt; in each period.  This turns out to more accurately model the movement of stock prices, as we'll discuss in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also abandon the numbers we used in our specific examples and replace them with variables. Let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S\)&lt;/span&gt; denote the price of the stock today, and let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(T\)&lt;/span&gt; denote the time until expiry of the option, in years.  We'll divide this period into &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(N\)&lt;/span&gt; equal time intervals, of length &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\Delta T = T / N\)&lt;/span&gt;.  Finally, assume that in each time period, the stock price changes by either multiplying by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(u\)&lt;/span&gt;, which we consider as an up movement, or by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d\)&lt;/span&gt;, the down movement. For example, if we assume that a stock can grow by 2% over a short time interval, then we pick &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(u = 1.02\)&lt;/span&gt;.  Thus after one period, the stock will have a value of either &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(Su\)&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(Sd\)&lt;/span&gt;.  We need to assume &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d &amp;lt; e^{r\Delta T} &amp;lt; u\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; is the risk-free interest rate, to avoid the possibility of arbitrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can then consider a tree of possible prices for the stock.  If &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt; time periods have passed, then the stock price at that time is determined by the number of up and down movements in the stock.  Since the order of the stock movements does not matter, we have that if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt; time periods have passed and the stock price has increased over &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt; of those periods (and therefore decreased over &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k-m\)&lt;/span&gt; of those periods), the price of the stock at that time is
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
S(k,m) = Su^{m}d^{k-m}
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This explains why this model is known as the binomial model - the price of the stock could be determined by flipping a coin &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt; times and assuming that the stock moves up each time a head appears. More properly, we should consider a weighted coin that has a probability &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; of coming up heads. The so-called "binomial distribution" is the distribution in probability used to model coin flips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now use the tree of stock prices produced by this formula to find the value of the option.  Assume we're pricing a call option with strike price &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(K\)&lt;/span&gt;. We can easily find the value of the option at the expiry in each of the possible nodes of the tree.  Under our model, the price of the stock has &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(N+1\)&lt;/span&gt; possible values at expiry, depending on the number of up-movements in the stock.  For each of these possible stock prices, the option is worth
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
C(N,m) = \max(S(N,m) - K, 0)
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(Here &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt; can be any of the values &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m = 0,1, \ldots, N\)&lt;/span&gt;). Interpreting the above formula, the option is worth the difference between the price of the stock and the strike price if the stock is worth more than the strike, and zero otherwise (the case in which the option is not exercised).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we know the value of the option at the end of the tree, we can work backward as before to figure out the value of the option at every node. Let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(C(k,m)\)&lt;/span&gt; denote the value of the option at the node that is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt; steps into the tree with &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt; up movements in the stock price.  The two following nodes in the tree are &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(C(k+1,m+1)\)&lt;/span&gt; (if the price moves up) and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(C(k+1,m)\)&lt;/span&gt; (if the price moves down).  If we let &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; denote the risk-neutral probability of a movement up, then the expected value of the option in the next step is
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
p C(k+1,m+1) + (1-p) C(k+1,m)
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and so the value of the option at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(C(k,m)\)&lt;/span&gt; is the above expected value, discounted to today using the risk-free interest rate.  That is
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
C(k,m) = e^{-r \Delta T} \left( p C(k+1,m+1) + (1-p) C(k+1,m) \right)
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With this formula, we can work our way backward through the tree until we can compute the value &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(C(0,0)\)&lt;/span&gt;, which is the value of the option today, and therefore the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need to find the value of the risk-neutral probability.  From our discussion in the last section, it should be chosen so that the stock price at any node in the tree is equal to the expected value of the stock price in the child nodes, appropriately discounted. That is, we need to chose the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; such that the following formula is satisfied:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
S(k,m) =  e^{-r \Delta T} \left( p S(k+1,m+1) + (1-p) S(k+1,m) \right)
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using the formula &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S(k,m) = Su^{m}d^{k-m}\)&lt;/span&gt;, we can solve this equation to find that the risk-neutral probability is
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
p = \frac{e^{r \Delta T} - d}{u-d}
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this formula does not depend on the values of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt;, so that the risk-neutral probability is the same everywhere in the tree. In contrast, we could consider using the replication method discussed in the previous post to compute the value of the option at each node. If we tried this, however, we'd notice that in general the payoffs at the child nodes are different as we move through the tree. Therefore we'd have to find a different replicating portfolio for every node, which would be a lot more work. Using risk-neutral pricing allows us to avoid these unnecessary computations and greatly simplifies the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Summarizing the Model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it! After a good deal of work, we've found a model that can be used to find the price of a European call option on a stock.  The model is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divide time until expiry of the option into &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(N\)&lt;/span&gt; intervals.  On each interval, assume that the stock can move up or down by a factor of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(u\)&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d\)&lt;/span&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This assumption generates a tree of possible prices for the stock.  At the leaves of the tree, we can find the value of the option for the given stock price represented by that node by using the payoff determined by the option contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working back through the tree, we can find the value of the option at any node as long as we know the value of the option at the two child nodes.  We do this by finding the expected value of the option at those two child nodes using the risk-neutral probability, then discounting that value using the risk-free interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process continues until the value of the option at the root node, representing the value today, is found, which is the price of the option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model uses three properties of the option that are known, namely the stock price today, the strike price of the option, and the time until expiry. It also takes as input the value &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(r\)&lt;/span&gt; for the risk-free interest rate available in the market. The model also has three "tuning parameters" that we can choose ourselves, namely the size of the movements &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(u\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d\)&lt;/span&gt; and the number of steps in the tree &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(N\)&lt;/span&gt;. If we want our model to be useful, we still need to decide how to choose these parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we saw above, our model is more accurate the more steps we include. Of course increasing &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(N\)&lt;/span&gt; increases the number of nodes in our tree, and so larger values of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(N\)&lt;/span&gt; will take longer to compute.  Therefore, we should choose &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(N\)&lt;/span&gt; as large as possible while still making sure that our algorithm is computationally feasible. We'll discuss this more in the next post, when we actually implement this model in Python and analyze its performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(u\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d\)&lt;/span&gt; is more difficult. There are good techniques for choosing these values, but understanding them requires making some more explicit assumptions about the movement of stock prices which we'll discuss in a later post. For now, it's enough to say that choosing &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(u\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d\)&lt;/span&gt; amounts to forecasting the future movement of the stock. We'll therefore choose them somewhat arbitrarily, picking feasible values and tweaking them as necessary so that the range of possible stock prices in the model accords with whatever prediction about the future movement of the stock we wish to make.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next Time - Implementing the Model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we've found a model we can use, it's time to actually put it into practice.  In the next post, we'll implement this model in Python and run it on a few simple examples. We'll also analyze its performance, and see how our implementation can be used to price other types of options as well.  &lt;/p&gt;

We didn't actually define or discuss the quaternions in &lt;a href="http://www.josephthurman.com/quaternions1.html"&gt;that post&lt;/a&gt;, but instead discussed the real and complex numbers.  It might be helpful to go back and skim that post again, especially the section defining the operations with complex numbers, as many of the properties of the quaternions are analogous to properties of the complex numbers.  With that preparation, though, we're finally ready to introduce and define the quaternions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Quaternions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw that the complex numbers can be constructed by considering a new number &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; with the property that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i^2 = -1\)&lt;/span&gt;, and then defining addition and multiplication of numbers of the form &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a + bi\)&lt;/span&gt; in a natural way. But why stop there? We can define other new numbers, which we'll denote by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(j\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;, and consider numbers of the form &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a + bi + cj + dk\)&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a,b,c,d\)&lt;/span&gt; are real numbers.  We call the collection of numbers of this form the &lt;em&gt;quaternions&lt;/em&gt;, which we denote by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{H}\)&lt;/span&gt;.  Here &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{H}\)&lt;/span&gt; stands for Hamilton, as in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton"&gt;William Rowan Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, the Irish mathematician who first constructed the quaternions. (The perhaps more natural &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{Q}\)&lt;/span&gt; is already taken, as this is used to denote the rational numbers.) We can see that the quaternions extend the complex numbers &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{C}\)&lt;/span&gt;, since we can consider a complex number &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a+bi\)&lt;/span&gt; as a quaternion &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a + bi + 0j + 0k\)&lt;/span&gt; where the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(j, k\)&lt;/span&gt; part of the quaternion are simply 0.  The quaternions are evidently a four-dimensional number system, as a single quaternion actually represents a set of four real numbers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the form &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(q = a + bi + cj + dk\)&lt;/span&gt; it is easy to see how to add quaternions.  We have, for two quaternions &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(q_0, q_1\)&lt;/span&gt;, that
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
q_0 + q_1 = (a_0 + b_0i + c_0j + d_0k) + (a_1 + b_1i + c_1j + d_1 k) = (a_0 + a_1) + (b_0 + b_1)i + (c_0 + c_1)j + (d_0 + d_1)k,
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
that is, we can add quaternions simply by "adding like terms."  Subtraction of quaternions is defined similarly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more difficult property to define is multiplication.  As in the case of the complex numbers, the crucial point is to understand how to define multiplication amongst the "new" numbers &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i, j, k\)&lt;/span&gt;.  The appropriate multiplication rules are what Hamilton discovered when he constructed the quaternions.  Apparently he was walking with his wife one day along a canal in Dublin when he suddenly realized the correct multiplication rule, and he was so excited that he immediately carved the formula into a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quaternions#Hamilton's_discovery"&gt;bridge along the canal&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here we use juxtaposition to denote multiplication, that is, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(ij\)&lt;/span&gt; means the same thing as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i \times j\)&lt;/span&gt;. We'll sometimes also denote multiplication with a small dot, e.g., &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i \cdot j\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above multiplication rule is more commonly written in the equivalent form
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1 \text{ and } ij = k = -ji.
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This latter form makes the most important feature of quaternion multiplication more obvious: it is &lt;em&gt;not commutative&lt;/em&gt;.  We say an operation is commutative if the order of the operands does not matter.  For example, addition of real numbers is commutative because &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a + b = b + a\)&lt;/span&gt; for all real numbers.  Likewise the multiplication of real numbers is commutative, as are both addition and multiplication of complex numbers. Subtraction of real numbers is not commutative, since in general &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a - b \neq b - a\)&lt;/span&gt;.  To say that quaternionic multiplication is not commutative is to say that if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p, q\)&lt;/span&gt; are quaternions, then in general we have that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p q \neq q p\)&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the above rules for multiplying the elements &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i, j, k\)&lt;/span&gt;, we can define the product of any two quaternions in a way that's very similar to the method for the complex numbers, by treating &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i, j, k\)&lt;/span&gt; as variables but simplifying any multiplication between these numbers using the multiplication rules above.  After a simple but somewhat tedious computation, we arrive at the following general formula for multiplication of any two quaternions:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
q_0 q_1 &amp;amp;= (a_0 + b_0i + c_0j + d_0k) \cdot (a_1 + b_1i + c_1j + d_1k) \\
&amp;amp;= (a_0 a_1 - b_0 b_1 -c_0 c_1 - d_0 d_1)+ (a_1 b_0 + a_0 b_1 - c_1 d_0 + c_0 d_1) i \\
 &amp;amp;\hspace{.25in}+ (a_1 c_0 + a_0 c_1 + b_1 d_0 - b_0 d_1)j + (-b_1 c_0 + b_0 c_1 + a_1 d_0 + a_0 d_1)k
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we'd like to consider quaternionic division as well.  Similar to the complex case, we will actually define an inverse operation, and again this will be based on a conjugation operation.  If &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(q = a + bi + cj +dk\)&lt;/span&gt; is a quaternion, then we will call &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;em&gt;real part&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(bi + cj + dk\)&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;em&gt;imaginary part&lt;/em&gt;, and once again the complex conjugation operation will consist of switching the sign of the imaginary part, that is
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
\overline{q} = a - bi - cj - dk
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just as in the case of complex numbers, we can observe that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(|q|^2 = q \overline{q} = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 +d^2\)&lt;/span&gt; is a real number (i.e., has no imaginary part), and that the inverse of a quaternion will be given by
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
q^{-1} = \frac{1}{|q|^2}\overline{q} = \frac{a}{a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2} + \frac{-b}{a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2}i + \frac{-c}{a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2}j + \frac{-d}{a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2}k
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fractions of quaternions, are actually not exactly defined since multiplication is not commutative.  If we'd like to take the quaternionic fraction &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{q}{p}\)&lt;/span&gt;, then, using the understanding that "division" means the same thing as "multiplying by the inverse", the value of the division should be the same as the number obtained by multiplying &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(q\)&lt;/span&gt; by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p^{-1}\)&lt;/span&gt;.  However there are two ways to do this multiplication, either &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p^{-1}q\)&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(qp^{-1}\)&lt;/span&gt;, that will in general not be the same since quaternionic multiplication is not commutative.  Therefore we will never write quaternions as fractions, and instead only consider multiplication by the inverse so that the order of the operands is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a note on terminology, in the last post we said that the real numbers and the complex numbers are both examples of &lt;em&gt;fields&lt;/em&gt; since they possess addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. One of the additional requirements of a field that went unmentioned in that post is that the multiplication in a field should be commutative. The quaternions are therefore not a field.  Instead, the quaternions are known as a "division algebra." The term "skew field" is also used in older books, but is less common today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;And Beyond&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous post, we saw that we could extend the one-dimensional real number system using the two-dimensional complex numbers.  In this post, we extended the complex numbers by the four-dimensional quaternions. Each time, we've managed to extend the number system by doubling the dimension. Could we keep going? Are there further number systems with dimension 8, 16, 32, and so on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is yes, although the number systems that arise in this way are not generally as useful.  Each extension process we have discussed so far is an example of a general construction called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayleyâ€“Dickson_construction"&gt;Cayley-Dickson construction&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a procedure that takes one of the number systems we have been discussing and produces a new number system of twice the dimension.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new number systems constructed by this process, though, always lose some of the desirable algebraic properties of the starting point.  For example, in moving from &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{R}\)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{C}\)&lt;/span&gt;, we lose the property that the real numbers are ordered. Similarly, we lose the commutativity of multiplication when we extend from &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{C}\)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{H}\)&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could apply the Cayley-Dickson construction again to the quaternions to produce an 8-dimensional number system called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion"&gt;octonions&lt;/a&gt;. In constructing these numbers, we lose the property of &lt;em&gt;associativity&lt;/em&gt; of multiplication, which is the property that the result of multiplication is independent of the grouping.  That is, given three numbers &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a, b, c\)&lt;/span&gt;, we could form the product of these numbers in two different ways (fixing the order), as either &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((ab)c\)&lt;/span&gt; or as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a(bc)\)&lt;/span&gt;. The reals, complexes, and quaternions are all associative, in that this grouping does not matter, e.g.,
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
(2 \cdot 3) \cdot 4 = 6 \cdot 4 = 24 = 2 \cdot 12 = 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 4)
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is no longer the case for the octonions. Even so, the octonions are still useful in mathematics and also in some physics applications, although we won't discuss the octonions any further.  One can continue past the octonions as well (the next number system is called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedenion"&gt;sedenions&lt;/a&gt;) but these further number systems are not commonly studied by mathematicians - after repeating the Cayley-Dickson construction so many times they have lost enough algebraic properties that they are no longer as useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why the Quaternions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above we've seen what the quaternions are from an axiomatic perspective. We've defined a quaternion as a collection of 4 real numbers, and given ways to add, subtract, multiply, and divide quaternions. This is interesting, but it may make the quaternions seem like an odd curiosity. Have we just found a set of weird rules for manipulating quadruplets of numbers, or do the quaternions actually amount to something?.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complex numbers have something of this flavor, as a weird system for manipulating pairs of numbers. But we saw in the previous post that they actually solve an important problem: they're an algebraically closed extension of the real numbers. What problems were the quaternions meant to solve? Why did Hamilton think they were important enough to vandalize a bridge when he discovered them? In our  next few posts, we'll answer that question, when we see that the quaternions are intimately related with the geometry of rotations in three dimensions.  &lt;/p&gt;

These special geometric properties are related to the algebraic properties of the &lt;em&gt;quaternions&lt;/em&gt;, a 4-dimensional number system that generalizes the somewhat more familiar real and complex number systems. In this post, we'll lay the groundwork for defining the quaternions by discussing some properties of the real and complex numbers. A good understanding of these two number systems, and especially of the complex numbers, will be necessary to understand the more complicated quaternions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Real Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real number system, often denote in mathematics by the symbol &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{R}\)&lt;/span&gt;, is the number system associated to the concept of the "number line" that is often taught in schools.  That is, if one considers a straight, infinitely long line, then every point on that line can be associated to a number.  We can choose a center point for the line, which we associate to the number 0, and then could repeatedly move to the right by a fixed distance to mark the points associated to 1, 2, 3, etc., and similarly to the left for the points -1, -2, -3, etc.  All other points on this line also represent numbers - the point exactly halfway between -1 and -2 is the point -3/2, while the number &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\pi = 3.14159\ldots\)&lt;/span&gt; is associated to a point that's a little to the right of 3, and so on.  All real numbers can be written as decimals (although those decimals might repeat infinitely, as in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1/3 = 0.3333333\ldots\)&lt;/span&gt;, or might even go one forever without any discernible pattern, as in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\pi\)&lt;/span&gt;), and using these decimal expressions we have methods for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing real numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The number line" src="http://www.josephthurman.com/numberline.png"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The real number line&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the idea of the real number line is fairly intuitive, the formal mathematical definition of the real numbers is rather complicated, and a great deal of mathematical energy was expended to define and understand the real numbers.  This technical work is in one sense extremely important to my own thesis work, in that it is the foundation for all of calculus and therefore for all of my work.  On the other hand, Newton and Leibniz invented calculus without a mathematically rigorous definition of the real number system, and if they didn't need all of the gory technical details, then we won't spend too much time worrying about them either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, we will say a few important facts about the real numbers.  First, the real numbers are a &lt;em&gt;field&lt;/em&gt;, the mathematical word for set equipped with operations that behave like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The abstract definition of a field was essentially made to generalize the structure of the real numbers.  The real number field has two extra properties, though, that make it special.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it is &lt;em&gt;ordered&lt;/em&gt;, that is, for any two numbers &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x, y\)&lt;/span&gt; we can always say that either &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x \leq y\)&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y \leq x\)&lt;/span&gt; (or both if we actually have &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x = y\)&lt;/span&gt;) and that this order satisfies some extra properties to make it consistent with the addition and multiplication operations. (One of these is that if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x \geq 0\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y \geq 0\)&lt;/span&gt;, then we also have that the product &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(xy \geq 0\)&lt;/span&gt;.)  Not every field is ordered. For example, since the complex numbers discussed below are two dimensional, they do not admit an order that's compatible with the field structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the real numbers are &lt;em&gt;Dedekind-complete&lt;/em&gt; with respect to this order. This property is also known as the "least upper bound property." It says that, given any non-empty collection of real numbers that has some upper bound (a number &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt; such that if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; is a number in the collection, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x \leq M\)&lt;/span&gt;), then that collection has a &lt;em&gt;smallest&lt;/em&gt; upper bound.  This is also not true for every field. In particular, the &lt;em&gt;rational&lt;/em&gt; numbers do not have this property.  The rational numbers are the set of numbers that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers (for example, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(2\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(-5/4\)&lt;/span&gt; are rational, while &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\pi\)&lt;/span&gt; is not). The rational numbers are also a field, since one can add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions (and the result is always a fraction), and are in fact an ordered field as well.  They are not, however, Dedekind-complete. To see why, consider the set of all rational numbers less than &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sqrt{2}\)&lt;/span&gt;. This set is bounded, and it's not hard to see that the least upper bound of this set is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sqrt{2}\)&lt;/span&gt;. But &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sqrt{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; is irrational, so the set of rational numbers does not have the least upper bound property since the least upper bound &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sqrt{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; is not itself a rational number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can show with a fair amount of work that these two properties uniquely determine the real numbers, that is, there is exactly one ordered, Dedekind-complete field. Still, making a formal mathematical construction of a field that satisfies these two properties is not easy, and the interested reader can search the internet for more information on either &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut"&gt;Dedekind cuts&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_of_the_real_numbers#Construction_from_Cauchy_sequences"&gt;Cauchy sequences&lt;/a&gt;. For the future, we'll only need the intuitive understanding of the real numbers as the points along the number line, but it's good to point out the difficulties in defining the real number line as an example of the way that seemingly intuitive concepts can hide a great deal of mathematical complexity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Complex Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One drawback of the real numbers is that they are not &lt;em&gt;algebraically closed&lt;/em&gt;. This means that not every real polynomial has real roots.  A &lt;em&gt;real polynomial&lt;/em&gt; is an expression with the form
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
where the coefficients &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a_n, \ldots, a_0\)&lt;/span&gt; are real numbers and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; is a variable.  A &lt;em&gt;root&lt;/em&gt; of a polynomial is a value for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; that makes &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p(x) = 0\)&lt;/span&gt;.  For example, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt; is a root of the polynomial &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(q(x) = x^2 - 1\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we can find polynomials with real-number coefficients that do not have any real-number roots, such as
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
p(x) = x^2 + 1
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For any real number &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;, the square &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x^2 \geq 0\)&lt;/span&gt;, and so &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x^2 + 1 &amp;gt; 0\)&lt;/span&gt; and there can be no real roots.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's somewhat inconvenient to have equations involving only real numbers that are still impossible to solve.  To fix this problem, we can define a new number &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt;, called the &lt;em&gt;imaginary unit&lt;/em&gt;, to be a number such that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i^2 = -1\)&lt;/span&gt; so that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; is a root of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p(x)\)&lt;/span&gt; above. This leads to the definition of the &lt;em&gt;complex numbers&lt;/em&gt;. A complex number &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(z\)&lt;/span&gt; consists of a pair of real numbers &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a, b\)&lt;/span&gt;, which we call the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;imaginary&lt;/em&gt; parts, respectively, and we write &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(z = a + bi\)&lt;/span&gt;. The set of all complex numbers is denoted by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{C}\)&lt;/span&gt;.  Note that we can consider the real numbers &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{R}\)&lt;/span&gt; as a subset of the complex numbers: if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt; is a real number, we can consider it as the complex number &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a + 0 i\)&lt;/span&gt;, that is, a complex number with no imaginary part. This is a two dimensional number system, since a number in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{C}\)&lt;/span&gt; actually consists of a &lt;em&gt;pair&lt;/em&gt; of real numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice of the word "imaginary" to describe these numbers is unfortunate, since it implies that these numbers aren't actually numbers and are just strange mathematical objects someone dreamed up. (This terminology was coined by Ren&amp;eacute; Descartes, of "I think therefore I am" fame, in order to denigrate the complex numbers in exactly this way.) And some would say this criticism makes sense. After all, these numbers are defined so that the equation &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X^2 + 1 = 0\)&lt;/span&gt; can have a solution, and some might say that this equation obviously has no solutions and it's silly to ask for one.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such objections are based on opinion, though, which doesn't really count for much in formal mathematics.  Worse, the same kind of argument could be used to ignore any number of mathematical topics.  Consider negative numbers: they were introduced to be able to solve equations like, say, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X + 5 = 2\)&lt;/span&gt;. But this equation is ridiculous and obviously shouldn't have a solution - after all, if you started with &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; apples and someone gave you five apples, how could you end with only 2?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguments about whether or not certain numbers are "real" in a philosophical sense can get surprisingly heated.  Consider for example the irrational numbers, that is, real numbers that are not rational numbers. Actually, if you happen to follow a Pythagorean philosophy, it's probably safer not to. The Pythagorean theorem is named after Pythagoras, an ancient Greek philosopher who also lead something like a cult that was based around mathematical principles.  His and his followers' theology was heavily influenced by music and harmony, where many important concepts like scales and consonance are related to having only whole-number ratios of numbers.  They were so invested in the divine order of rational numbers that it's sometimes said that they denied the existence of irrational numbers, going so far as to &lt;a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/did-pythagoras-really-murder-a-guy-1460668208"&gt;murder one of their own members&lt;/a&gt; for proving that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sqrt{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; is irrational. (The story of the murder probably isn't actually true, partly because there is some disagreement about exactly which irrational number was the cause for the murder. The story linked above says it's the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio"&gt;golden ratio&lt;/a&gt;, but the version with &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sqrt{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; is also common.) Somewhat ironically, the Pythagoreans would have thought about &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sqrt{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; because, if a perfect square has a side length of 1, then the length of the diagonal will be &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sqrt{2}\)&lt;/span&gt;, a fact that one can prove using the Pythagorean theorem.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus if you think it makes sense to talk about negative numbers, or irrational numbers, then you should think it makes perfectly good sense to talk about imaginary numbers and complex numbers as well.  If nothing else, we'll see in a later post that complex numbers can and do have a real physical significance, even if it's less obvious than applications of other number systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Operations with Complex Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With any concerns about the ontological status of the complex numbers brushed aside, we can now define operations with complex numbers. We will define addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division rules for complex numbers so that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathbb{C}\)&lt;/span&gt; is also a field.  Addition and subtraction are defined in a fairly straightforward way, essentially by considering &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; as a variable and combining like terms.  That is, if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(z = a + bi\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(w = c + di\)&lt;/span&gt; are complex numbers, then
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
z \pm w = (a + bi) \pm (c + di) = (a \pm c) + (b \pm d)i
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We just add (or subtract) the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.  Multiplication is defined by again treating &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; as a variable, but also making the simplification that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i^2 = -1\)&lt;/span&gt; wherever possible. Therefore we have
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
z \times w &amp;amp;= (a+bi) \times (c+di) \\
  &amp;amp;= ac + adi + bci + bdi^2 \\
  &amp;amp;= ac + adi + bci - bd \\
  &amp;amp;= (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We'll generally drop the multiplication sign, and denote multiplication just by juxtaposition, i.e., &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(zw\)&lt;/span&gt; means the same as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(z \times w\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To define division of complex numbers, we can consider one extra operation on complex numbers, called &lt;em&gt;complex conjugation&lt;/em&gt;.  Given a complex number &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(z = a + bi\)&lt;/span&gt;, then its complex conjugate, denoted by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\overline{z}\)&lt;/span&gt;, is the complex number &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\overline{z} = a - bi\)&lt;/span&gt;, that is, we switch the sign on the imaginary part of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(z\)&lt;/span&gt;.  Complex conjugation is special because the product of a complex number and its complex conjugate is always a real number:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
z \overline{z} &amp;amp;= (a+bi)(a-bi) \\
  &amp;amp;= a^2 - abi + abi - b^2 i^2 \\
  &amp;amp;= a^2 + b^2
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The number &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sqrt{z \overline{z}} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\)&lt;/span&gt; is also called the &lt;em&gt;norm&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;modulus&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(z\)&lt;/span&gt;, and will be discussed more in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have defined complex conjugation, we can write the rule for division of complex numbers. It's actually easier to define a different operation, called the &lt;em&gt;inverse&lt;/em&gt; of a complex number.  Given a nonzero complex number &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(z\)&lt;/span&gt;, we will define the inverse to be the complex number denoted by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(z^{-1}\)&lt;/span&gt; with the property that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(zz^{-1} = 1\)&lt;/span&gt;. (Zero has no inverse, since &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(0\)&lt;/span&gt; times any complex number can never be 1. This is ok because division by 0 is not defined anyway). Defining an inverse is the same as defining division, since division is just the operation that  undoes multiplication.  That is, if we have the product &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(wz\)&lt;/span&gt; and want to undo the multiplication by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(z\)&lt;/span&gt;, one way to do so would be to "divide by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(z\)&lt;/span&gt;" to be left with just &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(w\)&lt;/span&gt;.  Since we could also take &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((wz)z^{-1} = w (z z^{-1}) = w (1) = w\)&lt;/span&gt;, we define "division by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(z\)&lt;/span&gt;" to be the same as "multiplication by the inverse &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(z^{-1}\)&lt;/span&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the inverse?  Using the conjugation operator, we can define
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
z^{-1} = \frac{1}{|z|^2} \overline{z} = \frac{a}{a^2+b^2} - \frac{b}{a^2 + b^2}i
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To check that this is correct, observe that
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{align*}
zz^{-1} &amp;amp;= (a+bi)\left( \frac{a}{a^2+b^2} - \frac{b}{a^2 + b^2} i \right) \\
  &amp;amp;= \frac{a^2}{a^2 + b^2} - \frac{ab}{a^2 + b^2} i + \frac{ab}{a^2 + b^2} i - \frac{b^2}{a^2+b^2}i^2 \\
  &amp;amp;= \frac{a^2}{a^2 + b^2} + \frac{b^2}{a^2+b^2} = \frac{a^2+b^2}{a^2 + b^2} = 1
\end{align*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have that the complex numbers are a field, but what are they good for? Returning to the motivation for the construction of the complex numbers in the previous section, one can show that the complex numbers are algebraically closed. That is, any (nonconstant) polynomial with &lt;em&gt;complex&lt;/em&gt; coefficients will always have a complex root.  Since real numbers are themselves a subset of the complex numbers, this means that any polynomial equation with real coefficients can always be solved using complex numbers.  The fact that the complex numbers are algebraically closed is known as the "Fundamental Theorem of Algebra."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to one of the main situations in which a non-mathematician might have encountered complex numbers in school.  Many people learn the quadratic formula, which, given a quadratic equation of the form
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
ax^2 + bx + c = 0,
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
says that the solutions of this equation are given by the pair of values
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first time one encounters this formula, they learn that the number &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(b^2 - 4ac\)&lt;/span&gt; is called the &lt;em&gt;discriminant&lt;/em&gt;, and that the quadratic equation has no solution if this value is negative, since one cannot take the square root of a negative number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, one can't take the square root of a negative number and obtain a real number, but we've seen that the complex numbers are specifically constructed so that we can take square roots of negative numbers. The imaginary unit &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; is after all defined to be &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sqrt{-1}\)&lt;/span&gt;.  By expanding our number system and considering complex numbers, we can therefore see from this formula that all quadratic equations can be solved - we just have to use complex numbers for the solution in the case that the discriminant is negative. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, moreover, says that roots can be found for any polynomial, if one allows for complex number solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next Time - The Quaternions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this understanding of the real and complex number system, we're ready to actually define the quaternions in the next post.  We'll see that they are a four-dimensional extension of the complex numbers that has many of the same properties of the complex numbers, but with a few major differences as well.  &lt;/p&gt;

Some of the simplest derivatives are &lt;em&gt;European call&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;put&lt;/em&gt; options. In this post, we'll explain what these options are, and then describe a very simple model, the (one step) &lt;em&gt;Binomial Options Pricing Model&lt;/em&gt;, that can be used to find prices for these options. In the next post, we'll see how this model can be improved and expanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;European Call and Put Options&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A European &lt;em&gt;call&lt;/em&gt; option is a contract that gives one investor, who is said to have the &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; position in the contract, the option (but not the obligation) to &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; a particular asset at specified future time, called the &lt;em&gt;expiration time&lt;/em&gt; of the option, for a price specified at the time the contract is made.  This price is called the &lt;em&gt;strike&lt;/em&gt; price. Their counterparty, who must agree to sell at that particular price, is said to hold the &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; position in the contract. For a European &lt;em&gt;put&lt;/em&gt; option, the investor holding the long position has the option to &lt;em&gt;sell&lt;/em&gt; a particular asset at a specified time and price, while the person taking the short position agrees to buy at that price.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that long positions in options are always truly optional. That is, if a person holds a long position in a call option with a strike price of &amp;dollar;100, but the underlying asset's price is only &amp;dollar;95 when the option expires, they can simply chose not to &lt;em&gt;exercise&lt;/em&gt; their option, and buy the asset at the lower market price if they wish.  The short position in an option, though, carries an obligation. The holder of a short position in a call option, for example, is forced to sell an asset at a lower price than the market price if the call option is exercised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are options good for? An investor might wish to purchase a call option on a stock if they believe the stock price is likely to go up.  For example, say that a particular stock has a price of &amp;dollar;100 today.  If an investor believes that the stock price is likely to increase over six months, say to &amp;dollar;120, they might purchase a call option to buy the stock for a strike price of &amp;dollar;100 in six months.  If their prediction is correct, then in 6 months time they can exercise the call option to buy the stock for only &amp;dollar;100, then immediately resell in the normal market for &amp;dollar;20, netting a &amp;dollar;20 profit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if the investor thinks that the stock will be worth &amp;dollar;120, they could just buy the stock now for &amp;dollar;100 and make a &amp;dollar;20 profit in six months when they sell - what do they need the option for?  The option is an attractive investment because it is much cheaper to own than the stock itself. As we'll see below, the option on the stock above might cost in the neighborhood of &amp;dollar;10, so the investor could double their money with the option. This strategy is riskier, though - if the investor spends &amp;dollar;100 on the stock and it goes down to &amp;dollar;90, they've only lost &amp;dollar;10, while if the investor spends &amp;dollar;100 on 20 options and the price goes down, they lose their entire investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above is a description of the use of options for speculating in the market, but they can also be used like a type of insurance to hedge risk.  If an investor already owned that same &amp;dollar;100 stock and was worried that the value could drop drastically, they might purchase a put option with a strike price of &amp;dollar;90.  If the stock dives to &amp;dollar;80, they'll still be able to sell for &amp;dollar;90, limiting their loss to &amp;dollar;10 instead of &amp;dollar;20.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Simplest Binomial Model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's consider the simplest possible scenario in which to price a European call option. Say that a stock has a price today of &amp;dollar;100 (all prices will be in dollars, so we'll sometimes drop the dollar signs for convenience).  And let's assume that in six months' time, the stock will take one of only two possible values&amp;mdash;either increasing 20% to 120, or decreasing 20% to 80.  Consider a European call option for the stock with a strike price of 100 that expires in six months.  What is a fair price to pay for this option?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To decide on a price, we see that if we hold the option and the stock goes up, then we'll be able to exercise the option to make a profit of 20. If the stock price goes down, then at expiry there will be no reason to use the option and it will expire worthless for a profit of 0.  To find a price for this option, we will &lt;em&gt;replicate&lt;/em&gt; these possible cash flows using a combination of stocks and cash. (We use cash in this discussion to avoid discussing interest rates, which will be discussed in the next post.) Here, we're using one of the bedrock assumptions of mathematical finance, the "no-arbitrage" condition.  This condition says that if two different portfolios involve identical cashflows, then the portfolios must have exactly the same value. The price we'll find for the option is therefore called the &lt;em&gt;arbitrage-free&lt;/em&gt; price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a portfolio that consists of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a\)&lt;/span&gt; shares of the stock and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(b\)&lt;/span&gt; dollars in cash. That is, if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S\)&lt;/span&gt; is the price of the stock, the value of the portfolio is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P = aS + b\)&lt;/span&gt;.  We'd like this portfolio to have the same cash flows as the option, that is, in six months if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S = 80\)&lt;/span&gt;, we wish for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P = 0\)&lt;/span&gt;, while if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S = 120\)&lt;/span&gt;, then &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P = 20\)&lt;/span&gt;. You might recognize from these formulas that we're trying to choose the linear function &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(S)\)&lt;/span&gt; so that it has two particular values, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(80) = 0\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(120) = 20\)&lt;/span&gt;, and since two points always determine a unique line, we can solve to find that we should have &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a = 1/2\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(b = -40\)&lt;/span&gt;. Thus, if we have a portfolio that consists &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1/2\)&lt;/span&gt; a stock and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(-b\)&lt;/span&gt; dollars, this portfolio will have exactly the same payout as the option in 6 months, and therefore the value of the portfolio today must be the value of the option today.  Since the portfolio is worth &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((1/2) \times 100 - 40 = 10\)&lt;/span&gt; today, the price of the option must be &amp;dollar;10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still two issues to consider. First, this method of pricing requires us to own half a share in a stock, which is generally not possible.  In practice, this isn't actually an issue. We've assumed that the option contract we're pricing gives the option to buy or sell only one share of stock, but options generally involve 100 shares of stock.  Thus instead of buying 1/2 a stock, our argument above essentially says that we'd need to buy half of the number of shares specified in the option contract, that is, 50 shares.  The other issue is interpreting the negative value of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(b\)&lt;/span&gt;.  Here &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(b = -40\)&lt;/span&gt; means that the portfolio includes an obligation to make a payment of &amp;dollar;40 six months in the future, which we can think of as a repayment of a loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, if an investor wants to buy the call option on this stock we've discussed, they have two options. First, they could just buy the option itself, for a cost of &amp;dollar;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(C\)&lt;/span&gt;, and in six months they'll either receive &amp;dollar;20 or &amp;dollar;0 from the option, depending on whether the stock moves up or down.  On the other hand, they could take &amp;dollar;10 and take out an additional six-month loan of &amp;dollar;40, and use the combined sum to buy half a stock.  In 6 months, they can sell that half-share of stock and repay the loan. The payout from this process is identical to the payout of the call option, and this process costs &amp;dollar;10. Since the portfolio of stock and a loan replicates the payouts of the option, the prices are the same, and the option's price is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(C=10\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Risk-Neutral Pricing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the replication argument above works well in this simple case, we'll see in the next post that it can be difficult to generalize to more complicated models and situations.  For those situations, there is an alternate method to find the price of the option, using so called &lt;em&gt;risk-neutral&lt;/em&gt; pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One surprising fact about the replication argument is that it didn't include any probabilities. Let's momentarily ignore the argument above, and try to find the correct price of the option using probabilities. If we assume that the probability of the stock price increasing is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; (and therefore that the probability of a decrease is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1-p\)&lt;/span&gt;), then the expected value of the option 6 months from now is
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
E(C) = 20 \cdot p + 0\cdot(1-p) = 20p
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since the option is expected to be worth &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(20p\)&lt;/span&gt; at expiry, if we ignore interest rates (and risk, see below), its value today should be the same as well. We've found a price for the option, then, once we can determine a value for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the probability could in principle have any value between 0 and 1, and different investors might have different ideas of what the probability is.  There is one special value that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; could take, the so called &lt;em&gt;risk-neutral&lt;/em&gt; probability, that it turns out is better than all the others for pricing the option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find this probability, we can again perform an expected value calculation, but this time find the expected value of the stock in the future.  We then have
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
E(S) = 120\cdot p + 80 \cdot(1-p) = 80 + 40p
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then, similar to the above reasoning, if we &lt;em&gt;ignore the riskiness of the stock price&lt;/em&gt;, then the price today must equal the expected future value, that is
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation*}
100 = 80 + 40 p,
\end{equation*}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
which we can solve to find &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p = 1/2\)&lt;/span&gt;. This value of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; is called the risk-neutral probability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this called the "risk-neutral" probability? It's because a normal investor should think that the value of a stock today is &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; than the expected value of the stock in the future, because the future value is uncertain. If they thought the &amp;dollar;100 stock today would still be worth on average only &amp;dollar;100 in the future, they'd be better off just keeping their money and not taking any risk. Only an investor who is indifferent to risk would think that a stock with a risky expected value of &amp;dollar;100 in the future is also worth &amp;dollar;100 today. By equating the expected future value of the stock and the price of the stock today, we're therefore thinking like a &lt;em&gt;risk-neutral&lt;/em&gt; investor. We actually made the same assumption earlier when we said that the expected value of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(20p\)&lt;/span&gt; for the option in the future should equal the price of the option today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting these arguments together, we have that if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p = 1/2\)&lt;/span&gt; is the risk-neutral probability, then the risk-neutral price of the option today should be &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(20 \times (1/2) = 10\)&lt;/span&gt;, the same as the arbitrage-free price we found in the previous section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why Risk-Neutral Pricing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question "Why risk-neutral pricing?" could mean two different things, either "Why does risk-neutral pricing give the same price as replication?" or "Why use risk-neutral pricing instead of replication?". We'll answer the second question more fully in the next post, where we'll see that the risk-neutral pricing method is simpler when we consider more complicated models.  The first question does require an answer, though, because at first glance risk-neutral pricing seems like exactly the wrong method. Investors are generally &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; risk neutral, and investing is essentially all about either buying or selling risk. For example, investors are often either trying to create risk in the hope of a return (like the options speculator from earlier) or trying to hedge risks to remove uncertainty (like the use of options as insurance). How can ignoring one of the most important aspects of an investment lead to the right price?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see how, imagine that someone has cruelly forced you to &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; the option. Recall from above that this means that, if the stock price rises above &amp;dollar;100, you'll be forced to sell the stock for a below-market price. How might you manage this risk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One method would be to buy half a share of the stock. Let's consider the value of a portfolio that consists of half a share of stock, plus the short position in the option. If the stock price goes up to 120, then the option will be exercised and you'll unfortunately lose 20 on the option.  However, you will also own half a share of the stock, which in this world will have a value of 60, and so the total value of the portfolio is 40.  On the other hand, if the stock price goes down, the option will not be exercised, and the only value in the portfolio will be half the value of the stock, which will also be 40. (Note that this gives one more demonstration that the option is worth 10 - the future value of the portfolio is 40, not matter what, so the portfolio's value today is 40, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(50 - 10 = 40\)&lt;/span&gt;. This also does not assume risk-neutrality, since the future value of the portfolio is certain to be 40.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the risk in the option is completely manageable - by judiciously buying the stock related to the option, you can remove the risk inherent in the value of the option itself.  That is, instead of an uncertain position that could involve either no change in value or a loss of &amp;dollar;20, you know have a certain position that involves a final portfolio value of &amp;dollar;40 in all possible scenarios. Because the risk can be removed, it's doesn't determine the price of the option, and therefore you can use pricing methods that ignore risk to correctly price the option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this argument, and the replication argument from earlier, depend on the assumption that the market for the stock and the option are well-functioning. The replication argument assumed that money can be easily borrowed, and the hedging argument in this section requires that the stock on which the option is based can be traded. Neither assumption is always true. For example, there are options that pay depending on the weather, which could be used by a farmer, for example, to receive a payment in case bad weather causes problems with a crop.  The risk in this option is harder to hedge&amp;mdash;you can't buy or sell a drought. Risk-neutral pricing methods therefore require some assumptions to be made before they can be applied, and whether or not those assumptions are reasonable can determine whether the prices are correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next Time - Improving the Model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the model we've developed so far does work to give us prices for a call option (and also can be easily modified to give prices for put options well), the assumptions that we've made in our model are obviously too simplistic.  Stock prices, after all, can take many more than two possible values in the future. We've also ignored some other complicating factors, like interest rates, that can have a major effect on the price of the option. In the next post, we'll address these shortcomings to see how this binomial model gives accurate and useful prices for options contracts in real life.  &lt;/p&gt;

This is probably true for advanced research work in nearly any field, but I think the problem is especially bad in pure mathematics, largely for two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is that the the objects of study in mathematics are often unfamiliar and, to an outsider at least, hopelessly abstract. As a comparison, one of my brothers is also an academic, working on a PhD in biology and studying evolution in butterflies. The real details of his work are beyond me, but I learned the basics of evolution in high school, and I definitely know what a butterfly is, so he can tell me something about his work and I at least know what he's talking about. In contrast, my academic research involves various constructions related to quaternion-K&amp;auml;hler manifolds, and if you know what that means, congratulations to you on finishing your math PhD!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem is that the way that mathematicians think about math, especially the way they do research, is very different from the way that many people learn about mathematics in school. If you stopped learning math in high school or in a first-year calculus course in college, you probably think of math as a collection of formulas to be applied to solving problems on a worksheet. But before those formulas can be used to solve problems, someone has to come up with them, and understand why they work. Even more crucially, someone has to build the logical framework that gives the formulas and their applications context. This is what mathematicians actually do -- they define different abstract logical systems and try to understand their properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a simple example, consider arithmetic, that is, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  Middle school students learn algorithms like long division to compute these operations, and then spend weeks doing worksheets where they divide various numbers over and over.  This is important to be able to do, but a mathematician would want to ask more questions: for example, what is a number, exactly, and what does it mean to multiply two numbers? A mathematician might notice that multiplication is an operation that takes in two objects from the collection of numbers and produces a third number, subject to various rules - for example, commutativity (that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a \times b = b \times a\)&lt;/span&gt;) and distribution over addition (that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a \times (b + c) = a \times b + a \times c\)&lt;/span&gt;). They might then try to consider other collections of objects and construct multiplication-like rules for those collections. In particular, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion"&gt;quaternions&lt;/a&gt;, which feature prominently in my thesis, are a number system constructed by the mathematician William Rowan Hamilton in the process of trying to find a way to "multiply" triples of numbers. Thinking about these abstract structures and trying to deduce their properties is, to a mathematician at least, far more interesting that doing worksheet after worksheet of long division problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is the first in a series that will ultimately attempt to explain the results of my thesis to a general audience (or at least my family, who might be the only people who ever read this). I hope not only to explain the esoteric and abstract objects that I spend most of my time thinking about, but also to demonstrate the way that mathematicians think about math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before embarking on that journey, though, I'll give the shortest summary of my work that I can. It's common advice for academics of all types to always have an "elevator pitch" explanation of their research that they could give to anyone in under two minutes. Mine goes something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Two-Minute Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work in differential geometry, an area of mathematics that studies how to measure distances in spaces, and how spaces can themselves curve and bend. One of the most familiar geometric spaces is a flat, 2-dimensional, infinite plane - basically like a sheet of paper extended out as large as conceivably possible. High school geometry is really the study of this one space - learning about angles, distances, shapes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other spaces that one can study, though, with different geometries. As an example, consider the surface of the earth, which (if we imagine that the earth is perfectly smooth) has the geometry of a "round 2-sphere." It is also a two-dimensional geometry, in that you can specify a location on the surface of the earth using two numbers, latitude and longitude, and all the same concepts of geometry still apply - you can still talk about distances between points, angles, shapes on this surface, etc. It is very different from the flat geometry, though. For example, you could (in principle) continually walk in a fixed direction, and in doing so walk around the whole world and end up back at your starting point, which is definitely not possible on the flat plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main difference between these two geometries is a property called curvature. In two dimensions, there is a number that one can assign to every point of a space that describes how curved that space is at that point. For the flat piece of paper, that number is 0 for every point. For the sphere, that number is positive at every point. In fact, if &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt; is the radius of the sphere, then the curvature is given by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(1/R^2\)&lt;/span&gt;. For example, the curvature of the earth, which has a large radius, would be a small, but positive number. This agrees with our perception that the earth &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; flat when you walk around, and that you'd have to walk a long way to notice it curving. If you could walk around on the surface of a smaller sphere, like a basketball, you'd definitely notice the curvature. There are also two dimensional spaces of &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; curvature. "Negative" curvature just means that the surface curves in opposite directions. An example is the surface of a horse saddle -- the surface curves down to the ground on the left and right (where your legs go), but curves up to the sky in front and behind. A sphere always curves in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Illustration of Curvature Types" src="http://www.josephthurman.com/3spaces.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Examples of 2-dimensional surfaces with positive, zero, and negative curvature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These concepts are easy to visualize for two-dimensional surfaces sitting in three-dimensional space (as illustrated above), but most geometry research is concerned with higher dimensions, where things are much more complicated. According to general relativity, for example, the universe is a four-dimensional geometric object, with the three familiar spatial dimensions and an extra time dimension, and the way that this "spacetime" curves determines the gravitational field. The concept of curvature is also more complicated in higher dimensions,  where one needs many numbers to describe the curvature of the space in the many possible different directions, instead of the single number necessary in two dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated above, I study "quaternion-K&amp;auml;hler manifolds." These are higher-dimensional geometries, occurring in dimensions divisible by 4 (i.e., 4, 8, 12, ...) that have a very particular type of curvature, that makes them interesting in various mathematical applications and in theoretical physics.  My work on these spaces is an attempt to understand both how many different types of quaternion-K&amp;auml;hler manifolds exist and how these spaces can be used to construct other geometries with interesting curvature properties.&lt;/p&gt;
